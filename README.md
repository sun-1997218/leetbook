# Rust LeetCode Practice Notes

This repository is for recording my solutions to key LeetCode problems using the Rust programming language, currently focusing on the LeetCode Hot 100.

## Features
- All problems are implemented in Rust with clean code and clear comments
- Problems are organized by modules for easy lookup and review
- Many problems include detailed unit tests for validation and learning

## Project Structure
```
leetbook/
├── Cargo.toml         # Rust project configuration
├── src/
│   ├── main.rs        # Entry point
│   └── problems/      # Problem implementations and tests
│       ├── problem1.rs
│       ├── find_all_anagrams_in_a_string.rs
│       ├── ...
│       └── mod.rs
```

## How to Run / Test
1. Install Rust (recommended: [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
2. Clone this repository
3. In the project root, run:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```
   This will automatically run all unit tests for the problems.

## Who is this for?
- Anyone who wants to practice LeetCode in Rust
- Those looking for reference solutions and code style for common problems
- Anyone who wants to systematically organize and review algorithm problems

## Progress
- Currently working through the LeetCode Hot 100, updating continuously...
